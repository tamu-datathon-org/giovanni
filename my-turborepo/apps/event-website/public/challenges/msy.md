# 🔍 **Challenge Overview**

The **Mai Shan Yun Inventory Intelligence Challenge** invites you to design and build an interactive dashboard that transforms raw restaurant data into actionable intelligence.

You'll be working with a real dataset from **Mai Shan Yun**, including monthly purchase logs, ingredient usage, shipment details, and menu item sales trends.

**Your mission:** Help the restaurant optimize its inventory — minimizing waste, avoiding shortages, and predicting what to restock and when.

The best submissions will blend **data analytics**, **visual storytelling**, and **real-world impact** to make restaurant management smoother than a perfect stir-fry.

## 🏆**Suggested Features**

Your dashboard might include:

- **Interactive visualizations** of inventory levels, purchases, and usage trends.
- **Ingredient insights:** Track top-used and least-used ingredients by month.
- **Predictive analytics:** Forecast future ingredient needs based on menu item demand.
- **Shipment tracking:** Visualize shipment delays or frequency patterns.
- **Cost optimization:** Identify which items or ingredients drive the most spending.
